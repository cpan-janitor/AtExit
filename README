AtExit - a Perl module for exit processing

This is "AtExit", a Perl module which exports a function name "atexit()"
to perform ANSI-C style exit processing for Perl5 programs; and a class
named "AtExit" to register clean-up functions for any variable-scope in
which the AtExit object is defined.

You can read a nicely formatted version of the documentation for
this module online:

You should be able to install this using your usual method for installing
modules from CPAN. If you don't have a usual method, have a look at:
